# plant-disease-detection
To help both casual plant owners and experienced farmers understand the health of their plants, I aimed to make plant care accessible and understandable. Factors such as efficiency and accuracy were considered when determining the most effective detection model. All models were developed and modified in Python. Examining plant images, this research required classification models; I analyzed support vector machines, k-nearest-neighbors, gaussian naive bayes, random forests, and multi-layer perceptrons. With these models, I experimented with hyperparameter optimization to have more comprehensive data to yield when determining the most effective model. This optimization illuminated that the most effective model was a random forest model with 60 maximum features.
